  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 40) Martin didn’t say anything himself, but I knew that he was gutted and I didn’t let him pay for his share of the weed; he put a note down and when he wasn’t looking I screwed it up and threw it into his coat pocket with a sense of relief so huge it was disabling.

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 44) The house, the garden, moving.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 44) The whole thing was like a dream; for weeks Miri and I couldn’t believe it and wandered around the place with pangs in our stomachs, pre-emptive homesickness ready for the time when Dad and Lily would announce it was only a holiday and it was time to leave.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 44) Aside from our great-grandmother dying, we knew that it was Dad that had made it all happen, and we revered him as a wizard.

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 153) Maybe she’d bitten her lip.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 156) Miri spent most of the train journey to Calais trying to flirt with the bird, but it ignored her, snuggled deeper into my pocket and seemed to melt into hibernation—even its claws softened.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 156) The other people sitting around us seemed worried by the bird; they kept looking at the top of its head, which was all that was visible, as if they expected it to suddenly rise and start zooming around the train carriage, buzzing like a huge fly with a beak.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 156) But the bird relaxed until we’d docked at Dover, where it suddenly chirruped, struggled from my pocket to my shoulder, and threw itself at the air, singing madly.

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 172) Miri looked at me narrowly and I went and sat in a corner because we thought it was my fault; I’d done it with my shouting.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 177) Luc didn’t know why he couldn’t move.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 177) I knew why; it was because I’d leant all my weight, every wall and corridor, on his shoulders.

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 6) (My sister turned seventeen in a mental health clinic; I brought our birthday cake to her there.)
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 6) Miri’s accusations, her whole manner that night scared the shit out of me.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 6) She looked in my direction but she couldn’t seem to focus on me.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 6) She was the thinnest I’d ever seen her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 6) Her hands and head were the heaviest parts of her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 6) She hugged herself, her fingers pinning her dress to her ribs.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 6) There was an odd smell to her, heavy and thick.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 6) It was clear to me that she was slipping again, down a new slide.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 6) When she said she didn’t trust me, I turned away rather than let myself get angrier.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 21) Lily was the changer who came home the same.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 21) But that last time the signs were bad.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 21) When she left, she had forgotten her watch on the telephone stand in the hallway, a brass body with thin leather arms, ticking away Haitian time, six hours behind ours.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 21) How could she have forgotten her watch?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 21) Miri and I had debated leaving it where it was (that seemed luckier), then Miri had confiscated it for safekeeping in case one of the houseguests stole it or broke it or something.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) For a few months after we moved in it was just Lily, Miri, Dad and me in the house, no guests.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) Decorating happened, the kitchen got updated; Lily went away to Mexico and came back with a pair of shrivelled corn-husk dolls that she put on a shelf in her studio when Miri and I rejected them.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) During that time there was no better place in the neighbourhood for hide-and-seek, or for Robin Hood versus Sheriff of Nottingham swordstick fighting in the back garden.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) There was no better place to play Hitler Resistance Force, a game I made up so I could be Churchill.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) My first kiss was in the Andersen shelter, more a percussion of heads, faces, mouths than anything else.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) Emma’s the sort of girl who likes boys who have unpredictable moods and write poetry and imagine things, so I played up to that.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) We were in the shelter because she was supposed to be a Nazi double agent giving me secret information.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) For some reason whilst kissing her my main preoccupation was not hurting her or bruising her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) I tried not to hold her too hard.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 42) Her hair and skin were so soft.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) Dad had been a waiter, then a trainee chef, then a food critic, and each job had bored him to the point of existential crisis.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) This thing with the house was plan B.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) Or C, or D or X.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) Without the guests and the maintenance and the folders of forms and bills, Dad would just sit.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) It’s almost as if Lily knew, years and years in advance, that she was leaving us.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) As if she was gifting him something to be later, after her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) That’s not true, and it’s not possible, but .
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) the way she indulged him so completely.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) She gave him her house; Lily and Miri and I just lived in it.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) The capital man is the sum of his possessions.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 48) One evening she pattered around inside me, sipping something strong that wedged colour into her cheeks, and she dragged all my windows open, putting her glass down to struggle with the stiffer latches.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 48) I cried and cried for an hour or so, unable to bear the sound of my voice, so shrill and pleading, but unable to stop the will of the wind wheeling through me, cold in my insides.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 48) That was the first and last time I’ve heard my own voice.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 48) I suppose I am frightening.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 48) But Anna Good couldn’t hear me.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 48) When she closed me up again it was only because she was too cold.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 48) Most nights she went with the moon, and when it was round she stayed in my biggest bedroom and wouldn’t answer the thing that asked her to let it out (let you out from where?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 48) let me out from the small, the hot, the take me out of the fire i am ready i am hard like the stones you ate, bitter like those husks) the moonlight striped her, marked out places where the whispering thing would slip through and she would unfold.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 48) When Andrew went to war the sirens shrieked at night and the sky was full of squat balloons that flamed and ate bombs and would not move with the breeze, these balloons and nothing else, not even stars.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 117) The perfect person was a girl.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 117) Bobbed dark hair, black dress, pearls she was too young for, mouth, nose and chin familiar .
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 117) Miranda’s, almost.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 117) Look, look, remember.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 117) This sight might not come again.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 117) The perfect person had beautifully shaped hands, but no fingernails.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 117) A swanlike neck that met the jaw at a devastating but impossible angle.

--- Narrator 4 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 2) Does she remember me at all I miss her I miss the way her eyes are the same shade of grey no matter the strength or weakness of the light I miss the taste of her I see her in my sleep, a star planted seed-deep, her arms outstretched, her fists clenched, her black dress clinging to her like mud.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 5) We’d had an argument.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 5) Gusts of wind tangled in the apple trees around our house and dropped fruit onto the roof, made it sound like someone was tapping on the walls in the attic, Morse code for let me out, or something weirder.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 5) The argument was a stupid one that opened up a murky little mouth to take in other things.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 5) Principally it was about this pie I’d baked for her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 5) She wouldn’t eat any of it, and she wouldn’t let me.

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 7) Miri didn’t call after me.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 7) I don’t think she came upstairs again.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 7) Or she may have, without my hearing.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 7) I’m not sure.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 7) I heard the front door slam, but I thought it was just one of the guests coming home late.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 7) I stayed where I was, knelt on my window seat, smoking, seeing shapes in the rain, listening to all the apples in the world bouncing off our roof.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 8) That last time I saw Miri, she wasn’t wearing any shoes.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 8) Five months ago I took that as security that she would come back.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 8) And now I keep coming back to that in my mind, the fact that she was barefoot.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 8) That her running away was a heat-of-the-moment thing, unplanned.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 9) A part of me knows that we can’t find her because something has happened to her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 10) Miranda is at home (homesick, home sick) Miranda can’t come in today Miranda has a condition called pica she has eaten a great deal of chalk—she really can’t help herself—she has been very ill—Miranda has pica she can’t come in today, she is stretched out inside a wall she is feasting on plaster she has pica Probably not— I’ve been dialling her phone, the phone she lost months ago, as if she might have caught up with it somewhere.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 10) I wrote her a note and folded it in four and slipped it under her door.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 11) I know she’s not there.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 12) But I wrote, Miri I’m lonely.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 13) I dropped the words onto the paper so hard that they’re doubled by the thin perforations around them.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 14) I wouldn’t have bothered trying to tell her, I wouldn’t have written to her if What I mean is, each act of speech stands on the belief that someone will hear.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 14) My note to Miri says more than just I’m lonely.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 14) Invisibly it says that I know she will see this, and that when she sees this it will turn her, turn her back, return her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 16) She has wronged me I will not allow her to live Miranda lay beside me on the grass that circled the mill pond, her lecture notebook opened up on her stomach.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 16) Bicycles kept passing by, their wheels groaning against the wooden bridge.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 16) The sun shone through clouds swollen with the smell of wet bark, and there were bees around us.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 17) When I looked at her, she smiled brightly.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 17) Incongruous smiles were a sort of nervous thing with Miranda, a way of protecting herself from consequences, I think.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 17) Just like putting sunglasses on, or opening up an umbrella.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 18) I spent Lily’s second night in Haiti on Miri’s bedroom floor.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 18) Miri switched off the light and folded herself into her bed in her usual way, so that every part of her was covered and the bedsheets set around her curled body as if she was fixed in wax.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 18) I never knew how she managed to breathe.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 18) She said she slept like that so her dreams wouldn’t escape.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 19) I leaned my back against her desk, wrapped blankets around my shoulders and tried to read with a flashlight.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 20) I didn’t answer.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 20) I tried to picture our mother in Haiti and I saw her in a tower built of guns, heaving with voodoo, creepy gods and white feathers tipped with blood.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 22) Shrill singing between my ears.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 24) She was about to cry.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 24) There was a change in the shadows and I twisted around, looking into the corners where the lamplight cracked.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 25) Miri is the older twin.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 25) Maybe she has seen things that craned their necks to look at her and then withdrew before I was born, thinking that to consider one of us is to consider both.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 26) Later—when Dad told us what the voice in the phone had told him—prim, slender Miri folded her hands on the lap of her dress.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 26) She looked down and, for a moment, appeared to be smiling.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 26) She wasn’t smiling.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 26) She wasn’t in control of her face.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 36) He really has no idea what to do now, and because he is not mine I don’t care about him.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 36) I do, however, take great delight in the power of a push, a false burst of light at the bottom of a cliff, just one little encouragement to the end.
