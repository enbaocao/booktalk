=== EXAMPLE SENTENCES FOR EACH NARRATOR ===

--- Narrator 0 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 56) Lily can’t stand Pachelbel’s Canon!
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 259) You must have the hardest head in all creation,
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 267) I can’t be bothered.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 303) This house is bigger than you know!
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 303) There are extra floors, with lots of people on them.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 303) They look at you, and they never move.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 303) We do not like them.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 303) We do not like this house, and we are glad to be going away.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 467) I’m sorry I took your bike!
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 467) But I think it was fated.

--- Narrator 1 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 3) her ears are filled with earth
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 59) That day two bullets were for her; they found her and leapt into her lung.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 59) She fell amidst milling feet.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 59) Someone leant against her and pushed her aside, outside, out of life.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 59) She pushed back, sweat standing out on her skin in droplets as if she had been rained on.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 59) But her opponent had great wings, lined with clouds of feathers that brushed her, cooled her, pricked her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 59) The shadow of them darkened her sight.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 59) She tried to lift her head and see into the crowd.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 59) The other two she had been standing with, the newspaper journalists, her eyes couldn’t find them.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 59) She dribbled blood, could not let it go, closed her eyes only for the length of time it took to drink it up again.

--- Narrator 2 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) The perfect person was a girl.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) Bobbed dark hair, black dress, pearls she was too young for, mouth, nose and chin familiar .
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) Miranda’s, almost.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) Look, look, remember.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) This sight might not come again.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) The perfect person had beautifully shaped hands, but no fingernails.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) A swanlike neck that met the jaw at a devastating but impossible angle.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) Before Lily died, Miranda’s hair had been long enough to sit on.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) Me after the clinic, but perfect.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 240) Miranda turned the picture over and ran her hand over the back of it; in one, yes, two, three, four places the paper was rougher, once adhesive, now matted with fine hairs and specks of dust.

--- Narrator 3 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 7) Does she remember me at all I miss her I miss the way her eyes are the same shade of grey no matter the strength or weakness of the light I miss the taste of her I see her in my sleep, a star planted seed-deep, her arms outstretched, her fists clenched, her black dress clinging to her like mud.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) For a few months after we moved in it was just Lily, Miri, Dad and me in the house, no guests.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) Decorating happened, the kitchen got updated; Lily went away to Mexico and came back with a pair of shrivelled corn-husk dolls that she put on a shelf in her studio when Miri and I rejected them.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) During that time there was no better place in the neighbourhood for hide-and-seek, or for Robin Hood versus Sheriff of Nottingham swordstick fighting in the back garden.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) There was no better place to play Hitler Resistance Force, a game I made up so I could be Churchill.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) My first kiss was in the Andersen shelter, more a percussion of heads, faces, mouths than anything else.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) Emma’s the sort of girl who likes boys who have unpredictable moods and write poetry and imagine things, so I played up to that.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) We were in the shelter because she was supposed to be a Nazi double agent giving me secret information.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) For some reason whilst kissing her my main preoccupation was not hurting her or bruising her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) I tried not to hold her too hard.

--- Narrator 4 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 10) Why did you use the winter apples?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 17) (homesick, home sick)
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 19) eaten a great deal of chalk—she really can’t help herself—she has been
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 29) WHAT HAPPENED TO LILY SILVER?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 34) Don’t fall asleep yet.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 35) You’re scared about Lily.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 47) There is no such thing, Miri.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 49) Don’t say that.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 49) There is such a thing.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 52) Come on, don’t be a baby.

--- Narrator 5 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 28) me I will not allow her to live
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 64) I didn’t think you were doing it on purpose.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 64) But then I didn’t think you’d made a mistake.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 64) I don’t know what I thought.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 64) I suppose I thought you were calling me Mike because Mike was my name, if you see what I mean.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 334) I took the letter out of her hands and opened it for her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 334) She had been offered a place.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 334) I kissed her cheek and said congratulations.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 334) She opened her mouth and put one hand on her chest, the other to her cheek.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 334) She didn’t say anything.

--- Narrator 6 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) Shrill singing between my ears.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 93) Pie-kah, pie-kah, I’ve got pie-kah.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 335) My clever, darling girl,
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 720) We’ve been happy here,
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 799) Miranda was at my old school.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 840) I was just being silly.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 911) And lived happily ever after, I suppose,
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 951) My mental health is questionable anyway,
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 1031) Let me tell Eliot about this myself,
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 1062) I’m just really shit.

--- Narrator 7 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 46) Why are you saying this?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 46) It’s not true,
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 61) Why do people go to these places, these places that are not for them?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 107) She had had such a strong feeling that she needed to talk to someone who would tell her some secret that would make everything alright.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 107) She had been unable to think who it was.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 107) She had sat awake long hours downstairs, looking into the empty white arch of the fireplace, her hands on her rib cage.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 107) Who was it that needed to talk to her, that she needed to talk to?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 107) She had gone through lists of people it could be.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 107) She could only think of people that it couldn’t be.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 107) It wasn’t Lily, it wasn’t her father, it wasn’t Eliot, it wasn’t any of the poets whose words stuck spikes in her, not even Rumi.

--- Narrator 8 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 41) Quick, we’ve got to remember her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 43) We need more than that.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 43) What else do we know?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 43) What else is real about her?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 67) I love you, do you love me?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 120) But what will I do for a whole year?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 132) Are those girls running after us?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 177) I suppose so, but what am I going to do about clothes, then?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 208) What am I meant to do with these?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 246) Develop photos, I suppose.

--- Narrator 9 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 12) (My sister turned seventeen in a mental health clinic; I brought our birthday cake to her there.)
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 60) Stupid, stupid; Lily had been warned not to go to Haiti.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 72) Here’s the thing; can’t afford that this term.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 79) but ended up choking on a puff of dust that bolted down the chimney.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 79) Next Lily showed us the little ration-book larder behind the kitchen; the shelves were wonky and the room had a floor so crazily checked that none of us could walk in a straight line in there.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 79) I remember how brilliant I thought it all was; there was nothing for it but to jump in the air and yell and kick and make kung-fu noises.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 88) There is another shelter inside the house.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 88) It is beneath the sitting room with the fireplace; it is under a trapdoor set in the floor.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 88) The room is dim and long and deep; a room for sleeping in.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 88) Sleeping and not much else.
