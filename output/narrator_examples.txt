--- Narrator 3 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 7) Does she remember me at all I miss her I miss the way her eyes are the same shade of grey no matter the strength or weakness of the light I miss the taste of her I see her in my sleep, a star planted seed-deep, her arms outstretched, her fists clenched, her black dress clinging to her like mud.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 97) They moved with increasing disheartenment from shop to shop, hands in their coat pockets, looking at the floor more than they looked at the clothes, and finally, knowing that her only condition was that her dresses be black, he swiftly selected dresses off the racks for her to try, with the reasoning that he was more likely to approve an outfit if he’d chosen it.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 126) She tried to follow him in, but he suddenly and silently pushed the door against her until she squealed with pain; the pressure of the door between them threatened to throw her arm out of its socket.

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 421) she’s an affected little goose

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 544) Sean’s and Adam’s dogs chased each other around the room—Sean and Adam said that the dogs weren’t allowed to have names, so when they were in earshot we just identified them by colour—the black one was Sean’s and the brown one was Adam’s.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 551) Tijana had told me about a good half hour spent on a bench in Dover’s main square while some old black guy had explained to her that refugees were a drain on the resources provided by the taxpayer, so I don’t know exactly what I thought Dover would be.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 565) He reached across and went through the whole jazzy handshake thing again; I was better at it the second time.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 570) She produced it from the pocket of her cardigan; it was bound in plastic, and inside the pages were as crisp as if she had only just received it.

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 291) Emma texted me: Jean de Bergieres—they searched for her in the oven(!)

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 395) In my distraction I lost hold of the other black guests, the couple on the second floor who I had kept in their bed the past three days, curved around the bed like fitted sheets with their faces crusting over.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 395) The African with the silent chest chewed, swallowed and opened her mouth for more, while the couple picked up their cases and fled, leaving money on the hallway desk as payment for their stay.

--- Narrator 6 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 87) Still, Lily seemed to gaze and gaze at her and say, Oh, Miri.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 104) Was his cue written on the walls?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 292) I texted back: And what did they do when they found her?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 333) Sade seemed to laugh; at least, her shoulders shook.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 370) Miranda was on the point of saying that she might need to go away again.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 370) Only she wasn’t sure what good it would do.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 370) Hadn’t it begun while she was away?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 465) (did she mean to fall headfirst?)

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 38) To protect it from dust and flies, Lily had covered it with a square of checked cloth and an elastic band, rustic jam-jar style.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 39) That day two bullets were for her; they found her and leapt into her lung.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 39) She fell amidst milling feet.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 39) Someone leant against her and pushed her aside, outside, out of life.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 39) She pushed back, sweat standing out on her skin in droplets as if she had been rained on.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 39) But her opponent had great wings, lined with clouds of feathers that brushed her, cooled her, pricked her.

--- Narrator 8 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 41) Why do people go to these places, these places that are not for them?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 62) (let you out from where?

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 189) Even when no one is looking?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 190) But do you understand your nature?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 191) Did you choose to be good, or were you so created?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 193) Is that really an answer?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 373) What was there to say?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 462) What was the first word?

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 32) Lily was the changer who came home the same.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 32) But that last time the signs were bad.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 32) When she left, she had forgotten her watch on the telephone stand in the hallway, a brass body with thin leather arms, ticking away Haitian time, six hours behind ours.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 32) How could she have forgotten her watch?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 32) Miri and I had debated leaving it where it was (that seemed luckier), then Miri had confiscated it for safekeeping in case one of the houseguests stole it or broke it or something.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 40) Stupid, stupid; Lily had been warned not to go to Haiti.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 49) Miri and I were ten; Dad spent some time with a big map, planning a scenic route, and then he drove the moving van himself.
