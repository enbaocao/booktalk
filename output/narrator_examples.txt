  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 19) I hold my honey and I store my bread
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 38) A part of me knows that we can’t find her because something has happened to her.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 45) I know she’s not there.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 46) But I wrote, Miri I’m lonely.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 47) I dropped the words onto the paper so hard that they’re doubled by the thin perforations around them.

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 50) me I will not allow her to live

  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 34) (My sister turned seventeen in a mental health clinic; I brought our birthday cake to her there.)
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 65) Stupid, stupid; Lily had been warned not to go to Haiti.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 76) but ended up choking on a puff of dust that bolted down the chimney.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 76) Next Lily showed us the little ration-book larder behind the kitchen; the shelves were wonky and the room had a floor so crazily checked that none of us could walk in a straight line in there.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 76) I remember how brilliant I thought it all was; there was nothing for it but to jump in the air and yell and kick and make kung-fu noises.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 81) There is another shelter inside the house.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 81) It is beneath the sitting room with the fireplace; it is under a trapdoor set in the floor.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 81) The room is dim and long and deep; a room for sleeping in.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 81) Sleeping and not much else.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 81) I tried to revise for exams in there and ended up curled up on my side on the floor, snoring.

--- Narrator 7 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 31) Does she remember me at all I miss her I miss the way her eyes are the same shade of grey no matter the strength or weakness of the light I miss the taste of her I see her in my sleep, a star planted seed-deep, her arms outstretched, her fists clenched, her black dress clinging to her like mud.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 82) What took getting used to in Dover were the gulls and their croaky sobs, and the sense of climbing upstairs when walking on some roads and downstairs when walking on others.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 82) The house, the garden, moving.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 82) The whole thing was like a dream; for weeks Miri and I couldn’t believe it and wandered around the place with pangs in our stomachs, pre-emptive homesickness ready for the time when Dad and Lily would announce it was only a holiday and it was time to leave.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 82) Aside from our great-grandmother dying, we knew that it was Dad that had made it all happen, and we revered him as a wizard.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 192) This house is bigger than you know!
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 192) There are extra floors, with lots of people on them.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 192) They look at you, and they never move.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 192) We do not like them.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 192) We do not like this house, and we are glad to be going away.

--- Narrator 8 ---
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 66) Why do people go to these places, these places that are not for them?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 112) Still, Lily seemed to gaze and gaze at her and say, Oh, Miri.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 129) Was his cue written on the walls?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 200) Miri was like a mini-Sylvie, but she hadn’t always been.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 200) I can’t remember when she stopped wearing jeans and jumpers and skirts and started with the black and the severe outlines (why did she start?)
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 200) but I do remember Lily finding the change hilarious for months, and I also remember being embarrassed to have to be seen outdoors with Miri until I realised that no one seemed to think that her dress sense was odd.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 318) I texted back: And what did they do when they found her?
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 349) I wiped my face and went in for the next lesson.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 349) The duty to speak when Miri couldn’t, to make sense when she didn’t.
  (Conf: 1.00, Para: 349) I checked that no one was around, then put my forehead to my locker and stood against it just like a plank, with all my weight in my head.
